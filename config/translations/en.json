  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Question_5": "How does the Coach adapt to my fitness level?",
  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Answer_5": "Your Coach learns from the feedback you give. This includes the time it takes to complete a Coach assignment, but also the answers to the questions your Coach asks after a session. Therefore, it’s very important that you answer Coach feedback questions like “How was your technique?” or “How exhausting was the session?” honestly. Your Coach can also adapt to your unique circumstances. If you can do tough exercises like muscleups or strict pullups, let your Coach know so these exercises appear in your training schedule. And if you have certain equipment like a pullup bar or low bar, let your Coach know so your Coach assigns exercises that require these pieces of equipment.",
  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Question_6": "How can I integrate the Coach training into my daily life?",
  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Answer_6": "The Coach adapts to your circumstances and lifestyle. Choose and adjust the number of training days on a weekly basis. The 2x2 feature gives you even more flexibility.

  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Question_7": "What is a Weight Training Journey?",
  "BuyCoachPage.FAQ.Answer_7": "Freeletics Weights Journeys are strength-based workout plans that are focused on muscle gain and definition.
